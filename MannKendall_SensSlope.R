#Lake Superior National Estuarine Research Reserve, UW-Madison Division of Extension

#Data originated from NERRS CDMO: https://cdmo.baruch.sc.edu/ and 
#Data was compiled into csvs for all Reservesusing code from 
#https://github.com/Lake-Superior-Reserve/WQ_SWMP_Synthesis/tree/main/R/Data_processing
#This repo is currently private until analyses are complete, but will be made public after
#publication. 

#This code uses data from Lake Superior Reserve. This folder has been updated to the
#repo. Code showing how data was split out for Reserves is in 'Data Processing'.

# Mann-Kendall Trend test using {trend}
# Purpose: Identify monotonic trends in time series data. 
# This non-parametric test evaluates if there is a significant trend 
# (positive or negative) in the data over time.
# tau varies from -1 to 1 and indicates the strength and direction of teh trends, while the p-value 
# indicates statistical significance
# Assumptions: The data should be independent and identically distributed. 
# The test does not assume normality or linearity.

# Perform Mann-Kendall trend test on annual temperature data for station "lksbawq"
lksba_temp_annual <- wq_lks_annual_mean %>%
  filter(station == "lksbawq" & variable == "temp_mean")
mk.test(lksba_temp_annual$Mean, alternative = c("two.sided"), continuity = TRUE)

# No significant trends in temperature at a=0.05 present

# Perform Mann-Kendall trend test on annual specific conductance data for station "lksbawq"
lksba_spcond_annual <- wq_lks_annual_mean %>%
  filter(station == "lksbawq" & variable == "spcond_mean")
mk.test(lksba_spcond_annual$Mean, alternative = c("two.sided"), continuity = TRUE)

# Bingo! We have a trend! Tau is negative, so the trend is negative.
# This tracks with the plot

# Sen's Slope
# Purpose: Estimate the magnitude of the trend in the time series. 
# This non-parametric method provides a robust estimate of the trend's slope.
# Assumptions: The method assumes continuous data with independent errors and 
# does not require normality.

# Calculate Sen's slope for specific conductance data
sens.slope(lksba_spcond_annual$Mean, conf.level = 0.95)

# Most of the data is seasonal, so let's do a seasonal trend analysis using the monthly data

# Seasonal Mann-Kendall Trend Test
# Purpose: Account for seasonal variations in time series data and check if 
#trends are consistent across different seasons. 
# This test extends the Mann-Kendall test by incorporating seasonality into the 
# trend analysis.
# tau varies from -1 to 1 and indicates the strength and direction of teh trends, while the p-value 
# indicates statistical significance
# Assumptions: The test assumes monotonic trends within each season. 
# If the p-value for the van Belle and Hughes heterogeneity test is 
# significant (< 0.05), it indicates variability in trends across seasons.
# In other words, if p > 0.05, then you are good to go.

# We will use the EnvStats package because it is friendly to missing values.
# This package also allows us to test for heterogeneity in trends across seasons.


# Perform seasonal trend analysis using monthly data for temperature
lksba_temp_monthly <- wq_lks_mean_subset %>%
  filter(station == "lksbawq" & variable == "temp_mean")

kendallSeasonalTrendTest(value ~ month + year, data = lksba_temp_monthly, na.action = na.pass)

# Result: p-value for heterogeneity is greater than 0.05, 
#so we can assume that trends are monotonic across seasons,
#but trend v-values is also greater than 0.05, so not statistically significant


# Perform seasonal trend analysis using monthly data for specific conductance
lksba_spcond_monthly <- wq_lks_mean_subset %>%
  filter(station == "lksbawq" & variable == "spcond_mean")

kendallSeasonalTrendTest(value ~ month + year, data = lksba_spcond_monthly, na.action = na.pass)

# Result: p-value for heterogeneity is greater than 0.05, so we can assume that trends are monotonic across seasons; 
#slope p-value is 0.005, so it is significant at Î± = 0.05

# Compare seasonal trend results to Mann-Kendall test on aggregated yearly data
